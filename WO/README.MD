1. Actual work being done here

## Dir Description 

1. Since you are discovering new things there will be multiple versions of the same work which will be used as your tools 

Dir | What?
--- | --- 
[`WORK1`](./WORK1/) | 1st version of the work, this one records screenshots and videos. Will make a copy of this to continue the study work
[`WORK2`](./WORK2/) | 2nd version of the work, Testing out list of targets as a python list

- Note there are some problems with how you are handling requests , so put a pin in this, come back after completing the course 
- Main AIM was to create a tool for getting screnshots of website. But this can be done after you understand how to rename files, after it is being written. Or after understanding what more actions can be done on the page.
